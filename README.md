# vhdl_syntax_checker
Xilinx ISE's code editor is quite dated and does not hold up to todays standards. A better alternative is e.g. NotePad++, however it does not have syntax checking functionality. In order to check for syntax errors you would have to switch back and forth between NP++ and ISE, which is annoying. 
The scripts presented here allow syntax checking by just pressing a keyboard shortcut (e.g. F9).)
